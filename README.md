This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## F1 Champions

In this project we will use http://ergast.com/mrd/ to create a single page application that presents a list that shows the F1 world champions starting from 2005 until now.

## Decisions | Tech Stack

## Fetch only 5 years at a given time

Instead of fetching the entire set of data from 2005-2021 made a decision to divide it between 3 year ranges. Although fetching all data is relatively small I would not do that in prod as a good practice. Instead think of pagination.

## Axios Instance

I believe using Axios instance are a cleaner way to manage all endpoints and to create a single source for each endpoint. I would use this behavior in production code instead of directly accessing axios.get(). But to show how I would do so, Ive include an example in SessionModal

#### Redux-Toolkit
For state management I think the toolkit provides easy to implement, easy to maintain methods out of the box. Project required to handle data fetched from the given API. With toolkit itâ€™s easy to handle pending/fulfilled statues and also easily do error handling.


#### Cypress
A quick attempt to write some integration tests. Cypress initial setup is fairly straightforward.

#### React Testing Library
A quick attempt to write some unit tests as well. Given more time I would write more test the redux implementation and axios implementation
